									<h2>Work I did.</h2>
									<p>While working with an NGO, I focused on educating local students and parents about the right to education and the free education initiatives provided by the Indian government. My role involved creating awareness about how these programs could uplift underprivileged children by providing them access to education, which might otherwise be out of reach. I held interactive sessions to explain the long-term benefits of education, encouraging parents to enroll their children and take full advantage of the government's initiatives.

									</p><p>In addition to this, I led discussions on important health and hygiene practices. I educated the community on basic sanitation, emphasizing how maintaining cleanliness can prevent diseases and improve overall well-being. These sessions helped the community understand the connection between proper hygiene and their health, which is particularly crucial in areas with limited access to healthcare services.
										
										</p><p>I focused on environmental cleanliness, encouraging community members to adopt habits like proper waste management and recycling to maintain a cleaner environment. By discussing the impact of pollution and small everyday practices, I aimed to foster a sense of responsibility towards both personal and environmental well-being, ultimately contributing to a healthier and more sustainable community. </p>
